## Event Dispatcher

### What is the EventDispatch mechanism?
__EventDispatch__ is a mechanism for responding to user events.

The basics:

* Event listeners encapsulate your event processing code.
* Event dispatcher notifies listeners of user events.
* Event objects contain information about the event.
